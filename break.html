                          <em>Originally published in Catalyst Magazine, Issue 5 2017.</em>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div class="full">
                          <p>When I finally pulled down all my One Direction posters, I cried.</p><br>
                          <p>I was 17 years old, and the choice was entirely mine. But this wasn’t just a change in décor. To me, it was the end of a three-year relationship.</p><br>
                          <p>A casual observer would have called it an obsession. So would my mum, friends and anyone who had to spend time with me between the ages of 14 and 17. It wasn’t just an obsession, though. In my heart, I was really, truly in love. Until I wasn’t.</p><br>
                          <p>The pain of any break up is going to be relative to how invested you are in that relationship. When it came to my love affair with One Direction, I was very invested. I owned every album, made my own t-shirts to wear to concerts, and stood outside Crown for six hours during the 2012 Logies just to hear them sing through a wall for about five minutes. I also spent two years writing a 60 chapter, self-insert One Direction fanfiction that was quite popular in certain circles – not that I’m bragging.</p><br>
                          <p>Celebrity obsessions are unavoidable when you’re a teenager with a vivid imagination, a heart full of love and a lot of time on your hands. Musicians, actors and other famous, pretty people are packaged and presented with the express purpose of making us love them. They sell a fantasy, and we eat it up.</p><br>
                          <p>For me, the fantasy wasn’t particularly complicated. Cute, non-threatening, just-old-enough-to-be-exciting boys were exactly what was missing from my everyday life. In reality, the only people who had ever asked me out were one boy who’d been suspended for flashing girls on skype, and another who brought his own wisdom teeth to school in a jar.</p><br>
                          <p>But Liam Payne asking me to be his girlfriend mid-concert while he sang about my eyes in front of thousands of people? I wish I was exaggerating, but this is exactly the scene I wrote in my fanfiction.</p><br>
                          <p>Things were good for three tumultuous but blissful years. They released albums, I cried in my room while I listened to them. I tweeted them daily, and they didn’t reply. The kind of back and forth that rom-coms are made of. But even the brightest sparks can fade, and like the still-sweet boyfriend you’re just not that into anymore, there came a day when I had to break up with One Direction.</p><br>
                          <p>It wasn’t them, it was me. They’d done nothing wrong. But we were different people than we were back in 2011. The relationship wasn’t exciting anymore, and I got bored. I realised I was embarrassed to talk about them. I’m not proud of this embarrassment. Nobody should be embarrassed by what makes them happy, but I couldn’t deny that it was a sign. When I loved them – I mean really, truly loved them with every fibre of my 15-year-old being – I’d never cared what people thought of my interests.</p><br>
                          <p>I was over One Direction, but admitting it was hard. I still get a little sad looking back on those years. The memories are bittersweet. The people I went to concerts with and graciously let date the other members in my epic fanfiction adventure aren’t my friends anymore; more relationships I grew out of as I got older.</p><br>
                          <p>As tinged with embarrassment as my memories might be, I can’t begrudge my younger self her fantasies and obsessions. There’s a certain kind of unashamed passion and creativity that only a 15-year-old in love can know, and the most nostalgic parts of me miss that. I think I could learn a lot about love, loyalty and friendship from the girl I was then.</p><br>
                          <p>But like Gabriella crying as she told Troy she had to go her own way in High School Musical 2, so too did I shed tears as I folded up my life sized Liam Payne poster and placed it reverently in the recycling bin. It was finally time for me to go my own way, and I couldn’t look back.</p><br>
                          <p>That being said, Harry Styles can definitely still call me.</p><br>
                          <p>How you know it's over:</p>
              <em>
                            <ul>You pull down that last poster.</ul>
                            <ul>You donate all your tour shirts to the op shop.</ul>
                            <ul>You no longer imagine far-fetched romantic scenarios while awake, asleep or anywhere in between.</ul>
                            <ul>You stop defensively arguing that every member is hot.</ul>
                            <ul>You unfollow their mums on Instagram (you question why ever followed them in the first place).</ul>
                            <ul>You can voice minor criticisms without feeling like a shameful little traitor.</ul>
                            <ul>You delete your entire twitter because cleansing it of all the ‘notice me’ tweets is just too daunting an undertaking.</ul>
                            <ul>You illegally download their new album instead of buying the deluxe edition the second it comes out.</ul>
              </em>
